## Markdown Tips

If you are unfamiliar with MarkDown, check out 
[the official documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Note that IntelliJ IDEA has a Markdown preview that you can access in 
the upper-right of the editor. Also, since Markdown documents&mdash;like
source code&mdash;should be human-readable, make sure you keep your lines
short, as you can see I have done in my Markdown files.

Please remove this subsection before submitting your report. 

## Challenge #1 Complete



The solution for coding challenge one is simple. The description 
for challenge number one specifies that changes should not be made 
outside of the module configuration. More specifically, making no 
changes outside of the QueryEngineModule. In the module, the solution 
was obvious, seeing how the QueryEngine class was configured or bound 
to the FakeQueryEngine. All the FakeQueryEngine does is express that 
"Billy Bologna" is responsible for making all thirty or fewer of the 
most recent revisions on the article found based on the search bar 
input. In summary, the solution for this challenge was to replace 
FakeQueryEngine or with an actual query engine, or more specifically, 
the WikipediaQueryEngine, which searches its database and find the 
names of the 30 or fewer most recent people who revised the article 
found based on the input submitted in the search bar. 


## Challenge #2 Complete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #2. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Challenge #3 Complete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #3. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

(Write one or more paragraphs comparing and contrasting the iterative and functional  
approaches to string concatenation you explored in challenge #3. Which do you
prefer, and why?)

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

(Explain how polymorphism engendered dependency inversion in this little
application. Be clear and precise here, as this is, in part, an assessment of
your correct use of technical terminology.
Consider, for example, where exactly is polymorphism used?
Where exactly is a dependency inverted?)
